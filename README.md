# Customer churn prediction.
**What is Customer Churn?** 

Customer churn is defined as when customers or subscribers discontinue doing business with a firm or service. 

#### Objective:

To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

I will explore the data and try to answer some questions like:

* What's the % of Churn Customers and customers that keep in with the active services?
* Is there any patterns in Churn Customers based on the gender?
* Is there any patterns/preference in Churn Customers based on the type of service provided?
* What's the most profitable service types?
* Which features and services are most profitable?
* Many more questions that will arise during the analysis

#### Steps:
* Preprocessing
* Data visualization and analysis
* Training using machine learning algorithm
* Prediction

#### Models:
* SVC
* KNN
* Random Forest
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* AdaBoost Classifier
* Gradient Boosting Classifier
* VotingClassifier

#### Tools:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn and others

#### Result:
You can see my work more briefly in customer_churn.ipynb notebook.
